The dataset contains more than 14000 tweets data samples classified into 3 types: positive, negative, neutral.
In this machine learning project, we build a binary text classifier to classify the sentiment behind the text. We use the various NLP preprocessing techniques to clean the data and utilize the LSTM layers to build the text classifier.
